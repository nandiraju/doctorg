    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      1Cell.ai (“we”, “us”, or “our”) provides a mobile application for physicians to view, interact with, and order next-generation sequencing (NGS) patient reports, and to follow emerging trends in NGS and cancer genomics (the “App”).
      This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose and protect information through the App and our related services.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Scope</h2>
    <p>
      This policy covers data collected when you use the mobile application and any related services provided by 1Cell.ai. If you are a physician using the App on behalf of a healthcare organization, please follow any local policies and contracts that govern protected health information (PHI).
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>What information we collect</h2>
    <p>We collect information necessary to provide the App’s core functions (accessing and ordering NGS reports), to operate and secure the App, and to comply with legal obligations. Types of data we may collect include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Account & contact information:</strong> name, professional email address, phone number, affiliation or institution (provided at onboarding).</li>
      <li><strong>Identifiers:</strong> device identifiers, installation identifiers, and session identifiers used for authentication and security.</li>
      <li><strong>Health & clinical data (sensitive):</strong> patient NGS reports and clinical data that you upload or access via the App. This content is treated as sensitive and is handled according to the Security & Data Handling section below.</li>
      <li><strong>Order & usage data:</strong> test order details, timestamps, report access logs, and user actions within the App (to enable ordering and report retrieval).</li>
      <li><strong>Diagnostics & performance data:</strong> crash logs, performance metrics, and anonymized analytics to improve the App.</li>
      <li><strong>Communications:</strong> messages or support requests you submit via the App or support channels.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>How we use collected information</h2>
    <p>We use collected data for purposes including, but not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Providing, operating, and maintaining the App and its features (viewing reports, ordering tests, interactive report tools).</li>
      <li>Authenticating users and securing accounts and data access.</li>
      <li>Delivering test results, report notifications, and order confirmations.</li>
      <li>Improving product functionality, reliability, and performance through diagnostics and analytics.</li>
      <li>Responding to support inquiries and communicating product updates.</li>
      <li>Complying with laws, regulations, and valid legal requests.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Third-party services and partners</h2>
    <p>
      We may use third-party service providers to host infrastructure, deliver notifications, provide analytics, and perform crash reporting. These partners may receive technical data (e.g., device identifiers, crash logs, anonymized analytics) necessary to perform their services.
      If you add third-party SDKs or integrations to the App, those providers’ data collection must be disclosed and is your responsibility to track.
    </p>
    <p class="note">
      <strong>Important:</strong> If any third-party partner collects data from the App (for example analytics or monitoring SDKs), that collection must be represented in App Store privacy forms and here in this policy.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Data retention</h2>
    <p>
      We retain data for as long as necessary to provide the App and services, to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce agreements. For clinical content (patient reports), retention periods are subject to applicable healthcare laws and any agreements you have with 1Cell.ai or your healthcare institution.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
      We implement administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect data against unauthorized access, disclosure, or destruction. These measures include encryption in transit (HTTPS / TLS) and encryption at rest for stored clinical content where appropriate.
    </p>
    <p>
      While we strive to protect your data, no transmission or storage system can be guaranteed 100% secure. If you become aware of a security issue, please contact us immediately (see Contact section).
    </p>
  </section>

  

  <section>
    <h2>Your rights and choices</h2>
    <p>
      Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights to access, correct, export, or delete your personal data. You may also have rights to restrict or object to certain processing. To exercise these rights, please contact us at the address below.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>International transfers</h2>
    <p>
      Data we collect may be processed and stored in countries other than your own. When data is transferred internationally we take steps to ensure appropriate protections (contractual safeguards, standard contractual clauses, or other lawful transfer mechanisms).
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Children</h2>
    <p>
      The App is intended for licensed physicians and healthcare professionals. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under the age of 16. If you believe we have collected such data, please contact us immediately.
    </p>
